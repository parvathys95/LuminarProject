<p>Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.</p>
<p>Navbars can utilize .navbar-toggler, .navbar-collapse, and .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} classes to change when their content collapses behind a button. In combination with other utilities, you can easily choose when to show or hide particular elements. For navbars that never collapse, add the .navbar-expand class on the navbar. For navbars that always collapse, don’t add any .navbar-expand class.Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.</p>

    For navbars that never collapse, add the .navbar-expand class on the navbar. For navbars that always collapse, don’t add any .navbar-expand class. Use our position utilities to place navbars in non-static positions. Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed navbars use position: fixed, meaning they’re pulled from the normal flow of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., padding-top on the <body>) to prevent overlap with other elements.</p>
<p>
    Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:
    Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
    Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.
    Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.
    Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.
    Navbars are hidden by default when printing. Force them to be printed by adding .d-print to the .navbar. See the display utility class.
    Ensure accessibility by using a <nav> element or, if using a more generic element such as a <div>, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.

<p>A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.
A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it.
Tip: Inside a jumbotron you can put nearly any valid HTML, including other Bootstrap elements/classes.
Use a <div> element with class .jumbotron to create a jumbotron:

    A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
